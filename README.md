GTK 4 must be installed, and `pkg-config` must be available.
```sh
make init
make tiny-kyoukai
./tiny-kyoukai
```

**- Config -**
None at the moment.

**- It's not working ! -**
skill issue

**- Wayland support ? -**
you should KILL yourself NOW (use xorg like any sane person, wayland is for coomers)
